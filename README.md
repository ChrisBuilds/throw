## PREAMBLE

This project is old and unsupported. As is explained below, it was written a few years ago on a closed system with only Python 2.7 and notepad++ available. The quality of the code is not a representation of the author's current work. As such, this repo functions more as a project write-up than a code repository intended for distribution.
